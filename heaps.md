Heaps chapter in the following:

Smome important infor from teh above:

"Python only provides a built-in function for min heaps, but you can easily create a max heap for numeric values by 
multiplying each value by âˆ’1. A max heap with strings as keys is more challenging to implement. Instead of using the 
heapq library, you have to create one using a class or code a heap yourself."

"you can use heapq to handle priority-value pairs by storing tuples whose first element is the priority and the 
second element is the value"

Go over "Connecting Ropes with Minimal Cost" example for interview style problems and think of others 
which could be solved.

Use the following resource for easy, medium and hard problems and practice.

To do:
Implement heap sort in test
implement remove max or min value
check that min or max value updates
